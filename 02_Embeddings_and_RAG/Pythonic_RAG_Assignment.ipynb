        "- **SYNC (Synchronous)**: The application executes tasks sequentially - one at a time. Each task must complete before the next one begins. If you need 100 embeddings and each API call takes 2 seconds, the total time would be 200 seconds (100 × 2).\n",

            "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a situation where a CEO or startup founder, who was previously successful and experienced in a particular function (e.g., product management, sales, marketing), hires a weak executive to run that same function after becoming CEO. This happens because the CEO has a hard time letting go of the function that brought them success and wants to remain \"the man\" in that area. The term is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney who had been a brilliant TV network executive but, after acquiring ABC, the network fell to fourth place. Eisner's response was that if he had extra time, he could have turned ABC around himself, but he did not — illustrating the problem of not delegating strong executives for the former specialty area and instead possibly settling for weaker ones to maintain control.

            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "Answer: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to the phenomenon where a CEO or startup founder who used to excel in a particular function hires a weak executive to run that same function. This often happens because the CEO has difficulty letting go of the function that originally brought them success, and as a result, they intentionally or unintentionally hire someone weaker in that role so they can continue to be the dominant figure (\"the man\") in that area. For example, a CEO who was formerly a product manager might have a weak product management executive, or a CEO who was in sales might have a weak sales executive.\n",
            "\n",
            "The problem is named after Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney who was previously a brilliant TV network executive. When he bought ABC at Disney, ABC dropped to fourth place, and Eisner's response was that if he had two extra days a week, he could have turned ABC around himself. However, he did not have those extra days, illustrating the issue that a CEO cannot personally manage every function and that hiring weak executives in their former specialty can harm the company.\n",

When he bought ABC at Disney, it promptly fell to fourth place. His response? 'If I had an extra two days a week, I could turn around ABC myself.' Well, guess what, he didn’t have an extra two days a week. A CEO — or a startup founder — often has a hard time letting go of the function that brought him to the party. The result: you hire someone weak into the executive role for that function so that you can continue to be 'the man' — cons.\"\n",
